## Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM: Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)

In this project, I explore stock price prediction for **Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)** using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**, a specialized form of recurrent neural networks ideal for time series data. Leveraging historical stock data from **Yahoo Finance**, my goal is to develop a predictive model that captures the intricate patterns of META's stock prices. This approach highlights the synergy between machine learning and financial market analysis, offering insights into the future trends of META's stocks.
